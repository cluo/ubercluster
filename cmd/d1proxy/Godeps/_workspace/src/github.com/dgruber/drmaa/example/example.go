    This is a tiny example how to use DRMAA for job submission and
    gestatus for getting detailed job status.

    In order to use the program you need to usually the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    before starting (e.g. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SGE_ROOT/lib/lx-amd64)
    so that the DRMAA native library of the resource manager can be found.
